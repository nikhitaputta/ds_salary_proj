"Precision Nutrition
5.0",-1,2001,"Toronto, Canada",Education Training Services,"Wanted: A Data visualisation expert who will help us transform customer data into actionable insight

PN is looking for an ambitious, persuasive data visualization guru who’s passionate about health, fitness and helping people live their best life.

Precision Nutrition is growing, and we need a results-driven business intelligence analyst to mine our customer data, develop analysis and deliver recommendations to product and digital marketing groups. As one of the largest nutrition coaching companies in the world, PN is bigger than it’s ever been — and it’s about to get bigger.

To help us scale, we need a data visualization specialist who knows how to synthesize data into plain English so we can help millions more people live healthier, happier lives.

Join our Adventure

We’re embarking on a new adventure, and we need a multi-talented data scientist to drive the analysis that strengthens our product offers

We’ve got an exciting journey ahead of us… Over the next 10 years, Precision Nutrition will be expanding its world-class education and coaching services into a wide range of new fields, including yoga, group exercise, sports coaching, athletics, manual therapy and more.

To help us reach our goals and keep us moving forward, we need a data scientist who knows how to distill complex data into actionable steps—and communicate it to the right people.

Who we’re looking for

A shrewd data hound with the ability to communicate clearly

You’re naturally curious. You have an inquisitive mind, and you’re always looking for hard numbers to uncover patterns and insights in the way people think and work. You want to know what makes people tick, and gaining a deep understanding of your customers drives you to develop innovative solutions to solve their problems.

You’re self-motivated. Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don’t need a lot of direction. You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges. At the same time, you don’t silo yourself, and are always eager to learn more and share with the team.

You’re results-driven and have a strong bias for action. You get energized by developing recommendations that improve our product, and you excel at understanding and optimizing the journey our customers go through. You excel at knowing how to prioritize, adapt quickly when the scope changes—because it often will—and juggle lots of moving parts.

You’re a confident decision maker. Since you’ll be collaborating with people across the organization, you’ll be taking in a lot of competing input and synthesizing that into a specific course of action. You aren’t afraid to take on the authority and accountability needed to make a decision and drive the plan forward in the way you think will have the biggest effect. You don’t water down the plan to please everyone.

You’re an excellent communicator. You know how to say it, write it and present it in both layman’s terms and a bit more formally if needed. You know how to be heard and energize people around you, even when you’re “managing up” and presenting recommendations to the board.

You’re a motivating, team-oriented, people person. Let’s face it, in order to get other people to execute on your projects, you must be able to easily build relationships and credibility. You earn and give respect so that you can collaborate with the team and persuade the right people of your recommendations. Oh, and since you get to do all of this remotely, from the comfort of your home, and you won’t be going into an office every day to wrangle the team—so your people and leadership skills are truly first class.

What you’ll be doing

Seeking constant opportunities to make our product offerings better

You’re the navigator, deciphering the map and telling the captains the best course to their destination.

Your mission is simple: comb through customer data to find the best areas for improvement, and relay that to the business side of the company. That means:
Building and monitoring metrics. You’ll work through requirements for surveys and dashboards, and monitor KPIs over time to identify trends and build models that explain how our customers interact with our organization and use our product.
Collaborating with the data and analytics group. On the other end of things, you’ll also help set up and automate data collection and aggregation to support analytical needs.
Presenting to stakeholders. Once you identify areas for improvement, you’ll need to present your case to the marketing or product team, explaining what the data tells us and how to make that campaign or product feature better (or discussing possible areas we need to dig deeper).
A few important caveats

This is a dream job, if you’re the right person for it.

Must-Have #1: You must be experienced. We’re looking for someone with 3-5 years of experience in a data scientist position, ideally with a degree in math, stats, or computer science. You must have a demonstrated track record of going from data exploration to analysis and presentation of recommended actions that resulted in a business improvement.

Must-Have #2: You must know the tools of the trade. You have a solid understanding of data manipulation and visualization, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, and customer segmentation—and the tools that go along with those. You can develop visualization dashboards in reporting tools such as Tableau like a pro, and you have experience with data science tools like Heap, Panda, SciKit, and others, as well as manipulate and analyze data in SQL and Python.

Must-Have #3: You must be comfortable collaborating and communicating. Your job extends beyond analyzing the numbers, so you’ll need to be just as comfortable presenting recommendations to others as you are digging through data on your own. In particular, you excel at translating technical concepts into business-driven advice.

Wondering if this is the right path for you?

Every year, professionals at the top of their field choose to join Precision Nutrition.

Here are some reasons why.

Reason #1: We give you the freedom to “do you.”

Unlike most companies, we don’t have rigid rules about how and when to do things. You’ll always be free to work independently, whenever, wherever, and however you want -- without the bureaucracy and office politics.

Reason #2: You can work from anywhere.

We’re a 100% remote company, and have been working remote for 17 years. We’re ideally looking for candidates in Canada, but will consider the US as well. When you join our team, you’re no longer shackled to one desk in one office!

Reason #3: Meetings are optional. (No, really.)

You’re an adult. You’re capable of deciding how your time should be spent. If you don’t think you need to attend a meeting, you don’t. Simple as that.

Reason #4: You’ll always feel supported.

In a regular office, it’s easy to feel like a hamster in a wheel, powerless to change things. At Precision Nutrition, we work as a team to overcome issues & barriers that stand in each other’s way, and we treat each other with enthusiasm, compassion, and care.

Reason #5: You’ll never be bored.

People often come to Precision Nutrition after hitting a plateau in their old jobs. At PN, you’ll get the chance to chart new territories in your space, conquer new challenges, learn from the best, and reach thrilling new heights of personal and professional growth.

Reason #6: You’re free to be you.

At Precision Nutrition, we want everyone to live healthier, happier lives—no matter your race, age, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. That's why diversity is a key ingredient of our workforce, so we can best represent the people we serve. Everyone is welcome—as an inclusive workplace, we want our employees to bring their authentic whole selves to work. Be you.

Reason #7: You’ll have autonomy.

Not every data scientist job allows you time in the driver’s seat, but with this position, you’ll be taking charge of the analytical projects related to our product, and even make up your own projects that help make us better. You’ll never be bored by the range of tasks you get to work on.

Plus: no commute ... and no 9-to-5 grind.

"Roche
4.1","Novartis, AstraZeneca, Siemens Healthineers",1896,"Basel, Switzerland",Biotech & Pharmaceuticals,"Due to the continued growth of our pipeline we have opportunities for an exceptional statistician (s) at multiple levels to join our Biostatistics group.

As a Biostatistician at Roche you will be a key strategic partner in multi-disciplinary teams, working with colleagues based both locally and globally developing drugs in Phase 1 to 3 trials.

For those with existing experience you will be responsible for providing drug development and statistical expertise to the design and analysis of clinical studies which may extend to the entire global development program. You may also be responsible for providing statistical input to teams preparing for health authority submissions, leadership of other statisticians and related colleagues in health authority activities and participating in health authority interactions.

For those without (or more limited) direct experience of designing and analysing clinical trials we would be interested to learn about how your existing skills and other experience (e.g. during your degree) could be of use at Roche. In return, we will be able to provide you with full training and support to develop your career as a Biostatistician at Roche.

This is an opportunity to own your career development and be actively encouraged and supported through continual learning opportunities (including courses, local & global statistical and other scientific seminars, potential part-time study and rotations into related departments, two conferences per year, membership of industry/academic working groups such as through PSI).

You will be encouraged to pursue applied research on drug development opportunities and challenges as a continued part of your role, either alongside your project work or even as a formal rotation into our statistical methodology group. You will be given the freedom to discuss ideas and collaborate with over 200 Biostatisticians within Roche and other Data Scientists on drug development opportunities/challenges, as well as with key academics with whom we have consultancy arrangements.

Qualifications

You have qualifications that have given you the strong basis for your career so far (e.g. MSc or PhD in Statistics or related discipline) coupled with a programming language (e.g. SAS, R) that allows you to evaluate assumptions when designing clinical trials and then model/ explore data arising from clinical trials.

For the more senior roles you will need to have experience of study design and data analysis from different phases of drug development. You may also have experience in specialist areas such as analysis of biomarker data. For previous vacancies we’ve had success appointing statisticians from a range of backgrounds (e.g. academic settings, clinical research groups, CROs) so your own experience could have been gained outside of the traditional pharmaceutical industry.

Depending on your previous experience, you may have a good understanding of regulatory guidelines in drug development and have experience of participating or leading a team or sub-team working on a submission to a HA or HTA agency. It is also desirable that you have demonstrated leadership potential by leading such a team or sub-team.

To be successful in all of these roles you will need to provide evidence of conducting statistical research through your qualifications or current position.

We are keen to hear from those who have performed novel statistical work (perhaps unpublished) that has provided innovative approaches for your drug project team to consider. For those without drug development experience, we are keen to hear how you have pursued novel methodology (possibly as part of your university degree) and how such research may be applied in practice. You want to take on a role in a company that will provide you with opportunities and support, but then leave you to get on and make the most of those opportunities globally.

If you have some, but not all, of the above experience but believe that the global expertise of the Roche/Genentech people and the depth of the portfolio could be a place at which you could excel, then we’d very much like to hear what you have to offer.

Roche is currently supporting statisticians to pursue a PhD on a part-time basis, so would be interested to talk with you if you are doing likewise or considering this.

Our award-winning office, known as Hexagon Place, was opened in 2005 and provides a modern, flexible working environment with facilities that are second-to-none. Around 2,000 people work at our Welwyn office in Early Development (pRED), Product Development (PD), Commercial (Rx) and of course our Corporate functions.

There is a fully equipped gym on-site, a library and information centre, and an active sports and social club. We also have a subsidised staff restaurant providing foods to cater for every taste throughout the day. At the heart of the building is an informal meeting area known as The Street which features a coffee shop, snack machine and cashpoint. A second building on-site, called The Hub, contains modern meeting room and conference facilities.

If you are proud of contributing and feel you have the commitment to teamwork and innovation that we are seeking, then Roche is the organisation for you. In return we offer a competitive salary plus the excellent benefits you would expect from a blue-chip organisation, including a genuine interest in your development and progression.

You will be comfortable combining data engineering with modeling and analysis, to build out the foundation of data you can use to generate more complex insights. You will be as capable of writing documents, influencing an organization and leading a team as you are of digging into the details and executing as an individual.

Who we are:

http://www.rideco.com

RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses, vans, and cars. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, San Diego County, Grab, and Calgary Transit.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van/sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.

Who You’ll Work With

Billions of times a day, computers around the world communicate with the Cisco Advanced Malware Protection Cloud and rely on the AMP product to protect them against advanced forms of malware. Some malware is straightforward to identify, but antivirus has done that forever. Our customers need protection against malware that’s tricky to identify:
Viruses that generate different binaries on every machine they infect
Things that seem benign until you start looking closely at their behaviour
Malicious programs that have invented new ways of hiding themselves
To make the problem even more interesting: it may only become clear after a few days that a program or behavior was malicious. Does that sound fun to you?

The AMP Data Team is responsible for running advanced malware identification algorithms on incoming event data streams and storing and indexing that data. We index that data both for future detailed investigations of malware incidents, and to retrospectively detect previously unidentified malware in stored data. We strive for sub-second processing latencies in our streaming platforms and databases as they handle data volumes of >100TB/month and growing.

What You’ll do

Our team is looking for a backend Software Developer who will help scale our infrastructure as the business grows and continuously improve the software and infrastructure stack. You will also design and maintain automation and monitoring tools while working closely with Operations, QA and Production Support teams.

Who You Are

You are self-motivated, results-driven and engaged. You’re passionate about back-end development and enjoy collaborating in a team-based environment. You have fun learning new technologies. You want to get to the bottom of things, understand what’s going on, and make a difference. You are someone who doesn’t give up when faced with complex problems.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

"Altus Assessments
4.8",-1,2014,"Toronto, Canada",Computer Hardware & Software,"Our Purpose

We want to create a world served by exceptional professionals, and we do that by helping academic institutions find holistically stronger applicants by looking beyond metrics of “book smart”. Think of us like an “SAT” that evaluates who you are instead of what you know. Our main assessment, the CASPer test, is used widely for high stakes admissions to Healthcare Training, Teachers Education, and other academic programs in Canada, the US, and as far away as Australia. To date, we have had over 300 000 people take the CASPer test including 80% of all US and Canadian Medical School applicants.

Who We Are

We’re a quirky, vibrant, and diverse group of 60+ working collaboratively to tackle some tough problems (like how to evaluate empathy in someone who wants to train to become a doctor), and some less tough ones (like how to answer that bonus question on Trivia Night).

Our core values are caring, curious, and driven; we embody these values in everything that we do. We genuinely care about the well-being of others, we possess an innate desire to continually learn, and every day we strive to be better than the person we were the day before.

You can get to know some of us on our People of Altus blog!

Who Would Fit In

People who do well here are caring, humble, prefer change over the status-quo, are comfortable with “fuzzy” (vs well defined) tasks, and are ok with a daily helping of problem-solving. We all have a healthy appetite for learning and love to share our knowledge and teach our co-workers. We want people who put “we before me”. (You’ll learn more as you keep reading.)

The Role

Are you interested in engaging in diverse research programs in the field of assessment and admissions? We are looking for a research scientist to support high calibre research projects and to lead independent research. You will have the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on academic admissions across professions by helping us learn how our partners can select better professionals. You will engage in all stages of research including study design, instrument evaluation, data cleaning and analysis, report and publication writing, and presentations. Specifically, you will be responsible for: providing expert guidance in statistical methods for education and assessment, using R, R Markdown and Looker to quickly deliver professional reports, and enhancing the analytical capacity of the team by developing analysis standards.

4.9",-1,2016,"Montreal, Canada",Healthcare Services & Hospitals,"Dialogue's purpose is to improve humanity's well-being by using technology to deliver great care. In just a couple of years, we've established ourselves as a Canadian leader in virtual care, but we're just getting started on our journey.

We are looking for a Principal Applied Research Scientist, to join a talented multi-functional engineering and research team and focus on building the next generation of systems that will power the future of Dialogue.

About our technology


Dialogue's service runs on apps for patients and health-care providers. Behind beautifully-crafted user interfaces is the infrastructure of services built to allow us to scale while delivering an amazing experience for our members. ML systems are critical to both, scale and member experience.

Dialogue's back-end is architected as a set of micro-services, mostly written in Python, deployed on Kubernetes clusters, on AWS. The ML pipeline uses MLflow. One sub-system we've been investing a lot is a bot framework based on the Rasa platform. Our bots are built as human-in-the-loop systems, allowing healthcare providers to focus on what they do best; and leave other tasks to bots. This architecture helps us to create unique and high-quality datasets.

One of the bots we develop helps us evaluate the patient by collecting the relevant medical information. It has a medical NLU layer based on SpaCy and TensorFlow. We have a structured knowledge graph of medical concepts and an inference engine that recognizes hundreds of medical conditions by understanding over a thousand different symptoms and risk factors.

Another key system is a recommendation engine designed to determine the right next step for the patient's journey depending on a specific case.

What will you do


You'll work directly with the CTO, extended product and engineering teams to understand business priorities, challenges and the opportunities ahead. You'll then lead the research team to identify the most promising areas where ML systems can make the biggest impact. You'll put in place the right process for an applied research project to take models from the proof of concept all the way to production. You'll collaborate with the engineering and data science teams to make sure the research team has the right resources to succeed and to assure that the results of your research are integrated within the production system.

Even though management is a part of this role, most of your time will be focused on the applied research.

You'll perform data analysis to deeply understand the datasets of Dialogue and to shape their evolution. You'll work with a unique healthcare dataset including structured events, natural language, conversations, audio, images. You'll collaborate closely with experts in the medical field that can help improve models and generate more data.

You'll engage with the research community around the variety of topics relevant to your work, publish the results of your research and may contribute to an open-source project.

You'll develop the models and experiments, then write the code that will be pushed to production.

Who are we looking for


We're looking for someone who combines the extensive background in ML with a strong interest in building products and applying the results of their research.

You have a strong theoretical understanding of ML fundamentals and have developed good intuition about what approach could work best given the task at hand.

You have years of professional experience as a research scientist, data scientist or a software engineer. You are very comfortable with Python and modern ML tools. You have built production systems and/or published the results of your research.

Last but certainly not least, we're looking for someone who shares Dialogue values. To learn more about us, check out dialogue.co.

What we offer


Dialogue is fortunate to have the support needed to tackle such an ambitious goal and offer competitive compensation. All Dialogue employees are also equity holders, and you won't be an exception. Our health benefits are some of the best you can find, plus they're 100% funded by the company.

"Metamaterial Technologies Inc.
4.5",-1,2010,"Dartmouth, Canada",Aerospace & Defence,"Are you a PhD graduate looking to be part of an innovative and entrepreneurial team?

This is not your ordinary research job. You will bridge the gap between academia, industry partners and organizations! By working closely with members of Dalhousie University and MTI,you will deliver high‐quality research in an extraordinary field.

About MTI:

Metamaterial Technologies Inc. (MTI) is a smart materials and photonics company that is redefining the way we use, interact, and benefit from light.

We have embarked upon a new age of multifunctional materials—also known as metamaterials—with engineered properties that go far beyond what is found in nature. Our cutting-edge patented platform technology has been developed using a variety of smart materials that are capable of drastically altering the way light can be manipulated. These thin-films can absorb, block or enhance light, allowing us to “go beyond” what was once thought possible.

MTI specializes in metamaterial research, nanofabrication, and computational electromagnetics. Through the brilliance of our engineers, we have developed a wide array of metamaterial applications that encompass several industries, including aerospace and defense, healthcare, energy, education, and clean-tech. MTI is first in class when it comes to harnessing and mastering light. And through our innovation we have attracted international attention, because our ground-breaking technology is leaps and bounds ahead of its time.

MTI is headquartered in Halifax, Nova Scotia with global offices in London, England and Pleasanton, California.

We are proud to have received numerous awards including “Innovative Business of the year” award by Halifax’s Chamber of Commerce in 2016, “Employer of the year” award by Dalhousie University in 2017 and the “Red Herring” top 100 award in 2017 and many more!

About the role:

This is a joint research program between Dalhousie University and Metamaterial Technologies Inc. (MTI), funded by Mitacs Accelerate. The program runs in Halifax for 3.5 years from March 2019. This largest ever program of its kind in Atlantic Canada.

We are seeking 15 highly motivated interns (graduate students and postdocs) with interests in computational electromagnetics, metamaterials, light-matter interactions, radio-wave sensing, nanophotonics and nanofabrication. The interns will split their time between Dalhousie University and MTI.

The program aims to explore and develops innovative designs of resonant structures and novel metamaterial systems within the limits of advanced fabrication capabilities for next-generation light harvesting, optical imaging/filtering, thermal management systems, and enhanced spectroscopy tools in optical and radio-wave frequencies.

Overview:

The manipulation of light has been a key driving factor in human progress since the beginning of our species. Each industrial advance in the world has successively become more and more dependent on the manipulation of light and concomitant advances in our understanding of related phenomena: advances and discoveries in electricity, electromagnetic technology, wireless communications, lasers, and computers have all been driven by new understandings regarding the nature of light and what it is possible to do with it.

Advances in lithography and fabrication techniques in the last few decades have enabled us to control the optical properties of materials at the nanoscale, resulting in the emerging field of metamaterials. As the material size is reduced to deep subwavelength scales, novel designs have been proposed and demonstrated to enhance the light-matter interaction and enable efficient integration of ultra-compact and functional components into optical and electrical systems. As a result, many novel physical phenomena in this field have been introduced with application areas ranging from medicine to telecommunication, from solid-state lighting to spectroscopy. However, these studies so far were limited to lab-scale demonstrations and required expensive nanofabrication tools. There is a clear need for inexpensive fabrication techniques that will enable large-scale implementation of metamaterial-based new technologies.

MTI has recently developed an innovative technology for producing photonic metamaterials using a low cost, roll-to-roll process. This unique lithography technique provides a distinct capability to realize cost-effective, large-scale fabrication of flexible, nanostructured ultra-thin films for various new technologies. The program will also address scientific challenges induced by the fabrication limitations and develop alternative design solutions for improved device performance.

The program is divided into 5 research areas:

• Narrowband Laser Filtering Systems. Nano-structured thin film materials for transparent, ultra thin optical filters will be developed for applications in laser protection in aviation.

• Ultra-light-weight Photovoltaic Systems with high efficiencies. Highly efficient flexible solar panels for application in aerial vehicles, with improved overall efficiency of ultra-thin cells by collecting solar light from all angles and enhancing absorption across the most useful spectral regions.

• Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes. Optimization of LED emission enhancers that can be mounted on existing LED sources to substantially improve their luminosity, making them super-bright, dramatically brighter to current LED sources.

• Medical Diagnostics & Non-Invasive Sensing of Glucose Levels. Modelling and analysis of a dual-sensor glucose monitor that utilizes a wearable thin-film, which makes the skin transparent to radio waves and allows deep enough penetration to reach blood plasma.

• Flexible Transparent Conductive Films. Optimization of metallic mesh designs which would provide highest electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding with high transparency and investigate metallic mesh distributions that would minimize haze and obscuration.

Key responsibilities:

The position will be for a Research Scientist, that is expected to work in one or more areas of the program. We are seeking for people with interests in any of the following R&D tasks:

• Performing full-wave and numerical simulations to predict angle- and wavelength-dependent optical transmission and reflection.

• Building optical characterization tools and developing techniques which will enable angular-resolved transmission and reflection optical measurements

• Developing analytical models to predict angular transmission response of incident light

• Measuring angular-resolved spectral response of filters

• Develop new filter designs which will enable angle-independent performance

• Developing analytical models and perform full-field electromagnetic simulations to investigate resonant absorption in vertical and lateral cavities

• Investigating fabrication feasibility of promising designs using in-house holographic and RML techniques. Accordingly, identify promising and practical designs for fabrication.

• Measuring angular and spectrally-resolved optical response of fabricated structures, compare with theoretical models and numerical simulations

• Performance deficiencies will be identified, and structures modified, to optimize optical properties when matched with a variety of solar cell materials, including Si HIT, perovskite and organic thin films.

• Optical properties of films will be experimentally measured and compared with simulations.

• Perovskite and/or organic solar cells, fabricated at Dalhousie, will be characterized with and without the above films, as with Si HIT.

• Explore potential metamaterial structures and materials with promise to improve light outcoupling efficiency from typical LED emitters, such as the InGaN family of materials, as well as next-generation emitters, such as OLEDs. Specific wavelengths of interest for application in white-emitting LEDs will be targeted (both blue LED+phosphor, and RGB approaches)

• Results of the experiments will be compared with the theoretical calculations, and the process iterated to optimize metamaterial structures, and application procedures.

• Perform laboratory validation of a non-invasive, wireless glucose monitoring method based on a dynamically tunable radio-wave sensor enhanced by metamaterial films using non-biological tissue-mimicking phantoms.

• Explore metamaterial designs for impedance matching and integrate these with antennas.

• Perform laboratory measurements for the reduction of the reflection coefficient of the metamaterial structures in non-biological samples (acrylic slabs and skin phantoms)

At USD$3.3 Trillion, healthcare spending represents nearly 18% of U.S. GDP. It is complex and inefficient, with estimates of fraud and waste ranging up to 30% of total spending. Health service buying, selling, and settlements have seen little change in the past decade despite clear changes in available information, technology, regulation, and market consolidation.

Enter MacroHealth. MacroHealth is a mission driven company. We are building the most advanced and trusted market platform for health service payers and providers. The companys vision is to create Intelligent Health Markets by building technology, knowledge and relationships that enable payers and providers to optimize the buying and selling of health services.

We are expanding our team of passionate thought leaders as we pursue our goal of disrupting the U.S. health sector with our vision and technology. We are committed to developing leading edge solutions in a supportive environment focused on customer success and employee fulfillment.

Sunnybrook Research Institute (SRI) is seeking applications for the position of Director, Physical Sciences Platform. Applicants must hold a PhD in a relevant field (i.e. medical biophysics, bioengineering) and be eligible for appointment as a full-time Senior Scientist at SRI and as an Associate / Full Professor at the University of Toronto. We intend to nominate the selected candidate for a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair (CRC). To fill this leadership role, we are seeking an outstanding, internationally renowned researcher whose accomplishments have made a major impact in their field and is proposing to extend their work through an original, innovative research program of the highest quality at SRI. The successful candidate will have a track record of leadership with administrative experience and have a vision towards leading and growing the Physical Sciences Platform and strengthening collaborations with Biological Sciences, Evaluative Clinical Sciences and the Hospital. The Director will be expected to lead large, collaborative, cutting edge research endeavours that will yield scientific discoveries, clinical translation, commercialization and improved outcomes for patients.

About Sunnybrook Research Institute: SRI is an independent organization wholly owned by Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, one of Canada’s leading academic health sciences centres. SRI is the research enterprise for the hospital corporation and is fully affiliated with the University of Toronto. SRI has three research platforms: Biological Sciences, Evaluative Clinical Sciences and Physical Sciences, each of which functions similarly to a university department under the leadership of a cognate director. The institute supports $100 million of annual research activities within approximately 250,000 square feet of state-of-the-art research space located at the Bayview campus of Sunnybrook. SRI has one of the best recognized and most productive teams in the field of medical imaging and physical sciences research in the world. The Physical Sciences Platform is comprised of 64 scientists, and has a total staff of ~300, including close to 100 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows associated with the University of Toronto.

Research areas in Physical Sciences include Medical and Biological Imaging and Image Analysis (MRI, Ultrasound, X-Ray, Digital Pathology and Optical), Precision Medicine (Radiogenomics, Theranostics), Computational Modeling, Machine Learning, Nanomedicine, Design of Devices, Instrumentation and Interfaces, Biophysics and Bioengineering. A major focus of the Physical Sciences Platform at SRI is the field of Image Guided Therapy, reflected in support received from the Canada Foundation for Innovation leading to the establishment of the Centre for Research in Image Guided Therapeutics (CeRIGT), the FedDev-sponsored Image Guided Therapy cluster, and the current development of Inovait, an industry-academic consortium for AI and Image Guided Therapy supported by the federal Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF IV). The goal of the Physical Science Platform is to advance scientific discovery, develop new medical technologies and foster commercialization of discovery research. Our work further includes the delivery of novel diagnostic and interventional techniques to the hospital’s nine clinical programs: Holland Bone and Joint, Hurvitz Brain Sciences, Integrated Community Medicine, Odette Cancer, Schulich Heart, St. John’s Rehab, Tory Trauma, Veterans and DAN Women and Babies Programs. Scientists in this platform actively pursue opportunities to move their innovations through pre-clinical and first in human testing to commercialize the products of their research though the creation of start-ups and thought licensing, and routinely partner with many medical device companies in the development and assessment of new technologies.

The current Strategic Plan (2018-21) of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre aims to ensure that we can continue to achieve our vision of inventing the future of health care, and provide care for our patients and their families when it matters most. Our four Strategic Directions are focused on creating High Performing Teams that can develop Personalized and Precise Treatments, Integrated and Sustainable Models of Care, and Improve Quality and Create a Better Care Experience.

Responsibilities: Reporting to the Vice-President Research and Innovation, the Director will be responsible for the following: operations of the platform; strategic planning; recruitment; annual activities of research faculty; fiscal planning and accountability; and ensuring the integration of platform-based research with the strategic clinical directions of the hospital. The Director position will be initially awarded for a 5-year term, renewable following successful performance reviews, without a limit on the number of terms. The CRC is awarded for a 7-year term, renewable for a second 7-year term, contingent on a successful performance review.

Chef de file mondial de l'intelligence artificielle, Element AI poursuit un objectif commun, celui d'utiliser nos vastes capacités de recherche pour développer des produits et logiciels d'IA offrant des solutions aux problèmes complexes auxquels font face les entreprises et la société en général.

Nous croyons que l'être humain doit toujours rester au cœur de tout ce que nous faisons. C'est pourquoi nous avons adopté une approche collaborative et humaine, afin que nos objectifs restent toujours éthiques et ancrés dans le réel.

L'équipe de solutions – science et recherche accompagne les clients d'Element AI dans leur parcours vers l'IA. Nous sommes une équipe d'experts de l'intelligence artificielle dont le travail vise avant tout à répondre aux besoins concrets de nos clients. Nous souhaitons avoir un impact direct sur les interactions de nos utilisateurs avec leurs données, afin que cette relation leur permette de jouir d'un avantage puissant sur leurs concurrents. Nous sommes une équipe d'experts interdisciplinaire dont le mandat est de développer des outils basés sur l'apprentissage automatique et l'intelligence artificielle pour résoudre des problèmes industriels complexes dans les domaines des prévisions fondées sur l'analyse chronologique, de la détection d'anomalies temporelles et séquentielles, des systèmes de recommandation temporels, de la modélisation spatiotemporelle, des analyses de type « temps avant événement » et plusieurs autres.

Ce que vous ferez :

Confronté à des problèmes concrets et des jeux de données réels, vous devrez mettre à profit votre expertise et votre créativité pour appliquer les méthodes existantes (et en développer de nouvelles) afin de trouver des solutions pratiques et flexibles. Vous serez appelé à contribuer à l'évaluation de différentes possibilités et partager vos idées et vos commentaires concernant la conception des produits. Vous devrez donc évaluer et comprendre les besoins des clients (internes ou externes) pour les traduire en solutions pertinentes et applicables.

Vous devrez en outre effectuer la recherche nécessaire pour proposer des modèles et techniques appropriés et démontrer l'expertise pour mettre en place et former les modèles vous-même. Lorsque pertinent, vous n'hésiterez pas à appliquer les méthodes classiques d'apprentissage automatique, mais vous êtes également prêts à innover et repousser les frontières de l'apprentissage automatique, de l'apprentissage profond et de l'IA.

Finalement, vous devrez comprendre et accepter que la valeur de votre travail se reflète dans son impact sur l'utilisateur final de nos produits; trouver des façons de mesurer cet impact doit faire partie intégrante de votre mission. Vous devrez donc adopter une approche axée sur le client.

Profil recherché :

Vous avez une expérience considérable en modélisation et en analyse chronologiques, du point de vue de la prévision. Vous avez une connaissance approfondie ou un intérêt marqué pour la théorie derrière l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres domaines de l'IA, acquise au fil de vos études, de votre expérience dans l'industrie et de projets personnels sensationnels. Vous êtes à l'aise à exprimer vos idées sous forme de code et n'avez pas peur de vous retrousser les manches et contribuer aux tâches de programmation et d'ingénierie.

Vous comprenez que de tester un modèle avec les données variées et excessives associées à un contexte commercial est différent que de le tester dans un contexte académique « propre » — vous savez que de modifier un modèle ou une technique dans un tel environnement peut représenter un défi de taille. Cela ne vous effraie pas, vous avez peut-être même de l'expérience avec ce genre de défis.

Vous apprenez de manière autonome et vous êtes toujours à l'affût des plus récentes découvertes et techniques dans votre domaine; vous êtes motivé à participer aux différentes occasions d'apprentissage que nous offrons.

Le ou la candidat(e) idéal(e) aura de l'expérience ou de bonnes connaissances touchant à un vaste éventail de sujets : modélisation, représentation et analyse chronologique, nettoyage et ingénierie de données, répartition, ingénierie de fonctionnalités, processus stochastiques, modèles chronologiques classiques, techniques d'apprentissage automatique pour les problèmes de régression, etc. Si vous avez déjà résolu un problème de prévision chronologique de A à Z – vous serez à votre place dans notre équipe!

Ce que nous vous offrons :
Faites équipe avec d'autres passionnés de l'IA;
Profitez d'un excellent équilibre travail-vie;
Laissez votre marque dans une industrie en plein essor;
Déployez votre talent pour affronter de nouveaux défis chaque jour;
Vous serez étonné de tout ce que vous apprendrez;
Culture d'entreprise ouverte et inclusive.

Element AI is one of the world's largest artificial intelligence companies, with a shared goal of using our extensive research to develop AI products and software that will solve some of the most challenging issues facing businesses and society as a whole.

We are founded on the belief that humans should be at the heart of everything we do, and have adopted a people-first and collaborative mindset to ensure we collectively drive real and ethically-sound results.

The Science and Research solution team supports Element AI's clients on their AI journey. We are a group of artificial intelligence experts who thrives on solving concrete client needs. We aim to have a direct impact on our users' interactions with data and that this relationship is the key to get an unfair advantage on their competitors. The team is a cross-disciplinary team of experts that develops Machine Learning-based and AI-based tools for solving complex industrial problems in various fields such as time series forecasting, temporal and sequential anomaly detection, temporal recommendation systems, spatio-temporal modelling, time-to-event, and the like.

What you'll do:

You will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. You will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. This will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and translating them into solutions that address those needs.

You will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. Where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical forecasting methods, but you are enthusiastic about the idea of pushing the boundaries of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI.

Finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission. As such you will have a customer-first mindset.

What we're looking for:

You have significant experience with time series modelling and analysis from a forecasting perspective. You also have an understanding or significant interest in the underlying theory of machine learning or related AI field. This expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. You are comfortable expressing ideas into code and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks.

You understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arise in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. You embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it.

You learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date with the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer.

The ideal candidate would have experience or familiarity with topics such as time series data representation, modelling and analysis, data cleaning & engineering, imputation, feature engineering, stochastic processes, various classical time series models and machine learning techniques for regression problems. If you have experience solving a time series forecasting problem end to end, then you'll fit right in!

What we offer for your valuable work:
Work closely with other AI enthusiasts;
Enjoy your work and life harmony;
Leave your mark in a thriving industry;
Apply your talent to tackling new challenges everyday;
Be surprised at how much you will learn;
Open and inclusive company culture.
